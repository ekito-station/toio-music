# Toio Music
This program plays tones while changing the length at one time and the pitch based on the position of the toio.  
The larger the x-coordinate of the toio position, the longer the tone length at one time.  
The larger the y-coordinate of the toio position, the higher the tone.  
One toio can be operated by you and the other toio runs randomly.
## Requirements
- toio Core-cube x 2
- toio Play-mat

The interval between the start of one tone and the start of the next tone is fixed, even if the tone length changes based on the x-coordinate of the toio.
